{ File Help - Halting PVM & XPVM }
{ This function is identical to the PVM console "halt" command. }
{}
{ When the "Halt" button in XPVM is pressed, PVM will be shut down. }
{ All tasks will be killed, the Virtual Machine will be disconnected }
{ and halted (not the actual machines, just the PVM daemons :-), }
{ and XPVM and all PVM consoles will exit. }
