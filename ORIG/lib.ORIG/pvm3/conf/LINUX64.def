# Notes on readline Usage:
#
#	If your Linux system has readline, then you may append the
#	following flags to the defines below:
#
#		ARCHCFLAGS = . . .  -DHASREADLINE
#		ARCHLIB = . . .  -lreadline
#
#	and recompile PVM.
#
#	On some Linux systems, readline requires ncurses, so you
#	must also add "-lncurses" to the ARCHLIB define.
#
# Add define of HASSTDLIB for LINUX64 (copied from the LINUX template) 
# new definitions to allow, at least, "malloc.h" heder file include
# and thus not generate 32-bits truncating (thru "sxt4" assembly
# instruction ...) code, leading to Linux64 Virtual Memory addresses
# to be corrupted ("segments" bits are located in the highest weighted
# word/bits !!), on IA-64/Linux64 platforms.
