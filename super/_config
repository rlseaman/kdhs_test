#
#  Configuration file for the NEWFIRM DHS.  
#
#  The file format is a simple text table of the form
#
#	<task> <host> <name> <command>
#
#  where <task> is one of 
#
#	Supervisor	The DHS Supervisor process
#	Collector	A Collector component to accept data from a PAN
#	PicFeed		A PicFeed component to serialize the data
#	RTD		Real-Time Display component
#	DCA		Data Capture Agent which create a FITS file
#	KTM		Keyword Translation Module
#
#  The <host> host is the name of the machine on which the specified task
#  is to be started ('localhost' implies the current machine).  <name> is a
#  user-defined name of the task as it will appear in the status readouts,
#  commands are assumed to accept a "-name" flag to set this properly.
#  <command> is the path (on the named machine) to the command to execute,
#  the command may take arguments
#
#  Note that multiple instances of a <task> indicate multiple occurrances of
#  that process are requested.  If the task cannot be started on the
#  designated machine, another machine specified for that same class of task
#  will be used before finally falling back to the current machine.
#
#  Task names are case-insensitive and may be repeated.  Comments begin with
#  a '#' and extend to the end-of-line.  Column value may not be ommitted.
#  Comments and blank lines in this file are ignored, complex lines may be
#  continued with a backslash escape of the newline.
