node setup:

The DHS/panSaver opens a socket to a node in nfpan-AFR using port number
./lib/dcalib/dcaInitChannel.c
./super/superHandleClient.c
and talks to the collector and supervisor using ports:

supervisor port: 2005
collector port: 2001

Directory Contents:
-------------------

    README	    - This File

    startdhs	    - Start all client apps needed by the DHS.
    stopdhs	    - Stop all client apps needed by the DHS.
    smclean	    - Clean all remnants of the Shared Memory Cache, i.e.
		      destroy all shm segments owned by the user and remove
		      the default SMC cache file.

    bin		    - Application bin directory.  Users need not put this
		      in their path unless they need to start clients directly,
	 	      the DHS is started/stopped using the 'startdhs' and 
		      'stopdhs' scripts in this directory.
    include	    - Include files for interfaces used by the clients.
    lib		    - DHS Interface libraries

    collector	    - Source directory for the collector component.  The
		      collector receives pixel/metadata from the PanSaver 
		      and stores the result in the SMC.
    pxf		    - Source directory for the PXF component.  The PXF
		      monitors the SMC for new data and creates a FITS image
		      on disk.
    rtdstat	    - Source directory for the RTDSTAT (Real-Time Display
		      and status monitor).  This is a prototype GUI still
		      in development, currently used for the RTD functionality.
    smc		    - Source directory for the Shared Memory Cache (SMC)
		      interface.  The SMC allows data received by the Collector
		      to be processed by the PXF and RTDSTAT while still in
		      memory.  The SMC sources contain a number of test clients
		      that are installed in the bin directory, these include:

			zzcollector	Collector simulator able to emulate
					a complete readout of the instrument.
			zzdca		PXF simulator that simply consumes the
					data the way the PXF would but produces
					no output.
			zzrtd		RTD commandline client
			zzdebug		Interactive SMX debugging client

		      These tasks are installed in the bin directory and are
		      meant to be run only by knowledgable developers.

    client	    - PanSaver simulation client source
    super	    - Collector simulation client source
    util	    - Utilities source
